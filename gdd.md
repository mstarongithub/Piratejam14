### Main mechanics

Gameplay is split up into two distinct modes, overworld and tower defence

#### Overworld

While in the overworld, can select one tile next to already conquered tiles. At the start, players receive the center tile of a square map for free.

After selecting a tile, players can choose to attack it. This will initiate the tower defence mode. If they choose to not attack it, they go back to the tile selection

#### Tower defence

During the tower defence, players will utilise towers and planning to defend their new base against waves of enemies. There are a limited amount of waves in each tile, with each wave growing stronger. The wave count depends on the amount of conquered tiles.

At the end of the last wave, every standing tower will contribute towards giving the players new cards to use.

If the defence fails, that tile is considered lost and all investments into it are voided. A lost tile can't be conquered.

Once the player fails to conquer a tile and has no cards left, the game ends and shows a total score as well as some statistics

#### Cards

The game utilises cards to build towers. Every card represents one tower and can only be used once.

Players gain a minimum amount of cards every time they successfully conquer a tile. Each tower still standing once the players conquered a tile will award players with one random card per tower.

### Optional mechanics once base is good

- Bonus one time use items are awarded every x tiles conquered
- Scoreboard where players can enter their name after a run
