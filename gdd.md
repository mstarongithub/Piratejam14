### General Description

Use cards to build defensive infrastructure in a chunk. If the infrastructure holds against the thread that occupies the chunk, you can unlock the next adjacent chunk and gain new cards to use.  
No direct victory condition, get as many points as you can
End condition: No more cards and the infrastructure fails
